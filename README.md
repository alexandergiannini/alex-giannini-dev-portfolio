# Alex Giannini Dev Portfolio

# Hello there! My name is Alex Giannini and this is my dev portfolio. This is truly one of the biggest projects I've developed solo so while this was great experience, I know that this needs much more dev work, as well as more projects to utilize within this portfolio in the future. Anyways, please see the recent image of me, recent work, basic information, and various ways to reach out to me. Hope you enjoy, thanks!
