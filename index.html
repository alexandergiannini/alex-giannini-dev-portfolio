                Hi, welcome to my portfolio page! My name is Alexander Giannini, and I am striving to become a fullstack developer. Currently I am a student at the UCLA Extension Bootcamp, which is a part time course which runs for 6 months. By the time I finish, I hope to not only become a great developer, but also want to learn as much as I can and hopefully turn my career around and get a software engineering job! So far in this course, I have been having a blast! <br />
                <br />
                Besides coding, I work a full time job as a QA Analyst at <a href="https://www.goat.com/">GOAT</a> which is basically an ecommerce business revolved around the selling and buying of high profile sneakers, along with apparel and various accessories. Some of my hobbies include playing tennis, playing video games, and hanging out with my friends, family, and my lovely girlfriend. This has been a tough year during the pandemic, but hopefully things start looking better heading into 2021!
